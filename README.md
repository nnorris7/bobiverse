Code to support [The Bobiverse - Explained](https://normnorris.com/wordpress/category/bobiverse/) posts on my website.

Most of this code will probably be python, although there is the possibility that some Swift code will find it's way in.

While the code will include all the "statements" required to run, the environments (e.g. python modules, etc) are not included, so you'll need to know how to set those things up yourself in order to take this code and run it.
